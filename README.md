# Ncurses Game of Life

Based on Ncurses.

## Description

## Features

- Multi-threaded calculation
- Adjustable speed
- Different start patterns
- Show count of living cells
- Show number of cycles
- Detection for end of simulation
- Dynamic adjustment to changed terminal size
- Different ui styles of living cells

## Usage

- "q" key ends the program
- "Up", "Down" and "0" through "9" keys adjust the speed
- "Left" and "Right" keys initialize the cells to a different pattern
  - Random
  - Conway (text string)
  - Still lifes
  - Oscillators
  - Spaceships
  - Glider gun (Gosper and Simkin)
  - Pentomino
  - Diehard
  - Acorn
  - Block engine 1/2
  - Double block engine
- "Space" key restarts the current pattern
- "c" key changes the character style
  - 2 terminal characters representing 1 cell (Unicode blocks / "#")
  - 1 terminal character represents 2 cells (Unicode half blocks / ASCII)
  - 1 terminal character represents 8 cells (Unicode braille dots)
- "m" key changes the mode
  - NEXT: Jump to next pattern
  - LOOP: Restart current pattern
  - STOP: Stop when pattern is finished
- "h" show help
